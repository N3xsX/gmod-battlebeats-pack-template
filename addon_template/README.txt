You can find detailed instructions on how to make a BattleBeats addon in this Steam discussion:
https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3473911205/594021909912390256/

If you've downloaded this, it probably means you've already read it - and you're halfway there.
Inside some folders, you’ll find .txt files with additional instructions.

If you're ready and want to upload your addon, first delete all the .txt files and the thumbnail template.
Before uploading, I recommend testing your pack locally to make sure it works. 
To do that, place the main folder—named addon_template unless you've renamed it (which is allowed) inside your addons/ folder in the GMod directory 
(.../GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/...)

Then, launch the game with BattleBeats installed, enable Debug Mode in the settings, and restart the map (disconnect and start a new game).
Your pack should now appear in the pack selector UI. Use the track previewer to test if all your sounds play correctly.
