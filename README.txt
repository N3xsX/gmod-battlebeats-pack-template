 BattleBeats – Pack Creation Guide
=========================================

 -- FULL GUIDE --
You can find detailed instructions on how to make a BattleBeats addon here:
https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3473911205/594021909912390256/

If you've downloaded this, you’ve probably already read the guide – you’re halfway there!
Some folders contain additional .txt files with specific instructions

-----------------------------------------
 PREPARING YOUR ADDON
-----------------------------------------

1. When ready to upload:
   - Delete all .txt files from this template

2. (Optional) Rename the main folder from "addon_template" to your desired addon name
   - This is allowed and won’t break anything

-----------------------------------------
 TESTING LOCALLY BEFORE UPLOAD
-----------------------------------------

1. Place the main folder inside your GMod addons directory:
   .../GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/...

2. Launch GMod with BattleBeats installed

3. Enable Debug Mode:
   Q Menu (SpawnMenu) → Utilities → BattleBeats → Advanced → Enable "Debug"

4. Reload packs by:
   - Clicking the "Reload Packs" button under Debug Mode, OR
   - Restarting the map (disconnect → start new game)

5. Your pack should now appear in the Pack Selector UI
   - Wait until pack verification is complete. If something is wrong the pack panel will turn red and an exclamation mark will show up

-----------------------------------------
 USING LOCALLY WITHOUT UPLOADING
-----------------------------------------

If you want to use your pack without uploading to the Workshop:
1. Enable the "Load Local Packs" option in BattleBeats settings
2. Reload packs or restart the map (same as Debug Mode testing)
